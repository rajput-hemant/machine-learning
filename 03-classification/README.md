# Classification

It is defined as a Machine Learning technique to identify category of new observations based on the training data. It is a supervised learning technique where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model is then used to predict the class of new data points.

## Types of Classification

- Binary Classification
- Multi-class
- K-Nearest N Classification
- Multi-label Classification

## Algorithms

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
